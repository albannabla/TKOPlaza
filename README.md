Market Price Check for Tseung Kwan O Plaza, Hong Kong

This is a simple project that I have done to learn a bit of php. 
The goal of the project was to scrape data from a different website (in this case www.property.hk), calculate averages and plot the datapoints as google line charts. 
The webpage updates automatically every time you launch it (not on the link provided, since the hosting website is soooo slow, so I had replaced that part with a button to update manually). 

things that I have learned in this project: 
- how to convert a mysql result object into a format ready for google charts
- how to calculate averages by month in an array
- how to write and load data from a mysql database
- how to create a simple scraper in php
- how to use regular expression to scrape and check them using regex101.com
